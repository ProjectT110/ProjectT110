# ProjectT110
## Info
ProjectT110 is a project that is to bring ROMs, recoveries and other custom software to the T110 *(goyawifi)*.

Since this device has a Marvell CPU, it is closed-source and the device has no complete device trees required to build ROMs and more.

This project aims to complete those files and port Android ROMs like CyanogenMod and recoveries like TWRP 3.

## Current Goal
<input type="checkbox" checked>Kernel sources
<br>
<input type="checkbox" checked>Recovery device tree
<br>
<input type="checkbox">Complete device tree
<br>
<input type="checkbox">Port TWRP 3
<br>
<input type="checkbox">Get CyanogenMod to boot
<br>
<input type="checkbox">Finish CyanogenMod

### Our *current* goal is to get a stable CyanogenMod and TWRP 3 build, but when that's done, we'll *try to* port other ROMs and recoveries too! *(as long as we have free time and this project isn't discontiuned, of course)*
